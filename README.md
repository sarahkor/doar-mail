## Project Overview
- This is a fullstack Gmail-like web app built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. It supports user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication to securely access APIs.   

- Users can upload profile picture, see their account details, send an email and use features such as inbox, sent, drafts, trash, labels, starred, and mail search.
 
- The UI is responsive, built with React Router and Bootstrap. The backend communicates with a C++ blacklist socket server to validate outgoing mail links.

-  The entire system runs in Docker, with persistent url data stored via volume mounting.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React: Building a dynamic UI with reusable components.
- React Router: Client-side routing for navigation between views.
- Bootstrap (via CDN): For responsive and styled components.
- JWT Authentication: Used to handle login, protect routes, and attach tokens to requests.
- File Upload (Multer): Profile pictures uploaded via form using multipart/form-data.

### Backend
- Node.js + Express: Handles all HTTP API routes for user auth, mail operations, and labels.
- Multer: Middleware for handling image uploads from forms.
- JWT: Issued upon login, used for secure access to protected endpoints.
- Custom Validation: Server-side password and input validation for secure registration.
- C++ Socket Server: External service used for validating outgoing mail URLs (blacklist).

## How to Run Using Docker

 üìå **note: All commands and scripts should be run from the root of the project (create-our-gmail), as paths and dependencies are relative to it.**

### Tools nedded: 
- ‚Å† ‚Å†Docker Engine ‚â• 20.10
-  ‚Å†please make sure your Docker desktop is running

### Step 1 ‚Äì Create the .env File:
In the project root, create a .env file with:

``` bash
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
```
**Choose a strong JWT_SECRET (e.g., a long random string).

### Step 2 - Clean Old Containers (optional but recommended):

**optinal**: before creating new containers delete all (running or stopped) containers:

``` bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) 2>/dev/null || true
docker volume prune -f
docker network prune -f
```

### Step 3 - Build and Run Everything with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker compose up --build
```
This will:

**Build**:
- cpp-server (C++)

- web-server (Node.js backend)

- react-client (React via Nginx)

**Launch**:

C++ server with ./build/server 12345 8 1 2

### Step 4 - Accessing the Application:

Once the Docker containers are running:

Backend (Node.js Server) is available at http://localhost:8080

Frontend (React Client) is available at http://localhost:3000

‚úÖ You can browse the app from either port ‚Äî both serve the same client interface.
Port 3000 runs the React development server, while port 8080 runs the Node.js backend server with the same interface.

### Step 5 ‚Äì Access Containers (Optional):
To manually access a container (for debugging or inspection):
open a new terminal and write the following commands-

**For entering the C++ Server Container:**

```bash
docker exec -it server-container bash
```
This will give you an interactive shell inside the container.

Once inside, you can navigate to the data directory in order to see balcklisted urls:

```bash
cd data
```
Inside the data folder, you'll find the file urlsdata.txt, which contains the list of blacklisted URLs. To view its contents, run:

```bash
cat urlsdata.txt
```

**For entering the Web Server (Backend) Container:**

open an new teminal and write:

```bash
docker exec -it web-container bash
```
Once everything is running, You can now test API via curl.

### Step 6 -  Stop the System
```bash
docker compose down
```
To delete all volumes and reset data:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```


## üìÅ Data Persistence

- All blacklisted urls are stored in a Docker volume named `urldata`.
- This volume ensures that data remains even after containers are stopped or rebuilt.

### Important Notes

### üîê JWT Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: After successful login, the server returns a JWT token.
2. **Token Storage**: The token is securely stored in the browser's local storage.
3. **Authenticated Requests**: For every protected request, the token is included in the `Authorization` header

### Input Validation
- All user input is validated both on the frontend and backend.
- Includes checks for:
- Name and username length
- Password strength (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, minimum 8 characters)
- Valid email and phone number formats.
- Valid reciver name in a new mail.
- Valid label name.
- Users receive real-time feedback for invalid inputs.

### Security
- **Passwords** are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms before being stored.
- **JWT tokens** are signed and used to protect all API endpoints that require authentication.
- Backend verifies tokens and ensures users cannot access data they don‚Äôt own.
- Sensitive data is never exposed in responses.
