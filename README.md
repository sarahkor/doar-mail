## Project Overview
- This is a fullstack Gmail-like web app built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend. It supports user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication to securely access APIs.   

- Users can upload profile pictures, manage their account details, and use features such as inbox, sent, drafts, trash, labels, starred, and mail search.
 
- The UI is responsive, built with React Router and Bootstrap. The backend communicates with a C++ blacklist socket server to validate outgoing mail links.

-  The entire system runs in Docker, with persistent user data stored via volume mounting.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React: Building a dynamic UI with reusable components.
- React Router: Client-side routing for navigation between views.
- Bootstrap (via CDN): For responsive and styled components.
- JWT Authentication: Used to handle login, protect routes, and attach tokens to requests.
- File Upload (Multer): Profile pictures uploaded via form using multipart/form-data.

### Backend
- Node.js + Express: Handles all HTTP API routes for user auth, mail operations, and labels.
- Multer: Middleware for handling image uploads from forms.
- JWT: Issued upon login, used for secure access to protected endpoints.
- Custom Validation: Server-side password and input validation for secure registration.
- C++ Socket Server: External service used for validating outgoing mail URLs (blacklist).

## How to Run Using Docker

 üìå **note: All commands and scripts should be run from the root of the project (create-our-gmail), as paths and dependencies are relative to it.**

### Tools nedded: 
- ‚Å† ‚Å†Docker Engine ‚â• 20.10
-  ‚Å†please make sure your Docker desktop is running

### Step 1 ‚Äì Create the .env File:
In the project root, create a .env file with:

``` bash
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
```
**Choose a strong JWT_SECRET (e.g., a long random string). Do not use shared or example secrets in production.

### Step 2 - Clean Old Containers (optional but recommended):

**optinal**: before creating new containers delete all (running or stopped) containers:

``` bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) 2>/dev/null || true
docker volume prune -f
docker network prune -f
```

### Step 3 - Build and Run Everything with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker compose up --build
```
This will: **Build**:
- cpp-server (C++)

- web-server (Node.js backend)

- react-client (React via Nginx)

**Launch**:

C++ server with ./build/server 12345 8 1 2

Backend accessible at http://localhost:8080

React client accessible at http://localhost:3000

‚úÖ Now, you can browse the React client at: http://localhost:3000/

### Step 4 ‚Äì Access Containers (Optional):
To manually access a container (for debugging or inspection):
open a new terminal and write the following commands-

For entering the C++ Server Container:

```bash
docker exec -it server-container bash
```
after that you will be inside the server container
Then inside the container, run:

```bash
./build/server 12345 8 1 2
```
Explanation of the arguments:

 12345 =   Port to listen on.     
 8 =       Bloom filter size (bit array length).                     
 1 2 =      Seeds for hash functions (can be 1 or more integers)

And for Web Server (Backend) Container:
open an new teminal and write:

```bash
docker exec -it web-container bash
```
Once everything is running, You can now test API via curl.

### Step 5 -  Stop the System
```bash
docker compose down
```
To delete all volumes and reset data:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```


## üìÅ Data Persistence

- All blacklisted urls are stored in a Docker volume named `urldata`.
- This volume ensures that data remains even after containers are stopped or rebuilt.

### Important Notes

### üîê JWT Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: After successful login, the server returns a JWT token.
2. **Token Storage**: The token is securely stored in the browser's local storage.
3. **Authenticated Requests**: For every protected request, the token is included in the `Authorization` header

### Input Validation
- All user input is validated both on the frontend and backend.
- Includes checks for:
- Name and username length
- Password strength (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character, minimum 8 characters)
- Valid email and phone number formats
- Users receive real-time feedback for invalid inputs.

### Security
- **Passwords** are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms before being stored.
- **JWT tokens** are signed and used to protect all API endpoints that require authentication.
- Backend verifies tokens and ensures users cannot access data they don‚Äôt own.
- Sensitive data is never exposed in responses.
